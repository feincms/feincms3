Plugins (``feincms3.plugins``)
==============================

.. note::
   The content types in `FeinCMS <https://github.com/feincms/feincms>`__
   had ways to process requests and responses themselves, the
   ``.process()`` and ``.finalize()`` methods. feincms3 plugins do not
   offer this. The feincms3 way to achieve the same thing is by using
   :ref:`apps <apps-and-instances>` or by adding the functionality in
   your own views (which are much simpler than the view in FeinCMS was).
