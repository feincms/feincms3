feincms3
========

Version |release|

feincms3 offers tools and building blocks which make building a CMS that
is versatile, powerful and tailor-made at the same time for each project
a reachable reality.

It builds on other powerful tools such as Django itself and its admin
interface, `django-content-editor
<https://django-content-editor.readthedocs.io>`__ to allow creating and
editing structured content and `django-tree-queries
<https://github.com/matthiask/django-tree-queries>`__ for querying
hierarchical data such as page trees.

The tools can be used for a page CMS, but also work well for other types
of content such as news magazines or API backends for mobile apps.

.. note::
   Despite its version number feincms3 is already used in production on
   many sites and backwards compatibility isn't broken lightly.

Embedding apps

feincms3 allows content managers to freely place pre-defined
applications in the page tree. Examples for apps include forms, or a
news app with archives, detail pages etc.

The apps documentation is meant to be read in order.
